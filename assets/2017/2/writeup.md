# [<t style="color: orange;">ORANGE</t>] LCM LCM

### Problem Description

Lom and Chaz are ready to begin cooking and are faced with a number of refrigerators containing ingredients for their dishes. The organizers of the cooking competition, being the number lovers they are, printed two numbers on each fridge, and made a strange rule for the chefs to follow: the chefs may grab no more ingredients than the _least common multiple_ of the two numbers on each fridge.

The least _common multiple_ of two numbers is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of both numbers.

Since Lom and Chazâ€™s brains are far too consumed with cooking knowledge to understand math, they need your help. **Write a function which takes two integers and returns the least common multiple of them.**
