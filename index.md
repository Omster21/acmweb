The Wisconsin-Dairyland chapter of the [CSTA](http://csta.acm.org/), in conjunction with the [Marquette University](http://www.marquette.edu/) chapters of ACM and [UPE](http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~upsilon/), welcomes high school students with Java or Scratch programming experience to participate in a morning of computer science problem solving and/or storytelling.

This year's Wisconsin-Dairyland Competition will again feature two divisions:

## Java Division

A traditional team-based programming competition, modeled on the [ACM](http://www.acm.org/) [International Collegiate Programming Contest](http://icpc.baylor.edu/). Teams of 3 or 4 students will have three hours and two computers to work collaboratively to solve problems similar in scope to [Advanced Placement Computer Science](https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/) exam questions. Points will be awarded based on the number of problems correctly solved and the time taken to solve, with appropriate penalties for incorrect submissions. Development environments available will most likely include [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/), [WordPad](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/wordpad) \+ [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), [Cygwin tools](https://www.cygwin.com/) and [BlueJ](http://www.bluej.org/).

See examples of problems from previous competitions:

## Open/Scratch Division

Teams of 2 or 3 students will have three hours and one computer to implement a themed [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) project. Submissions will be judged on creativity, use of key [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) constructs, and theme correspondence. This division will be suitable for introductory students familiar with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

## Logistics

Competition location: Marquette University campus, in downtown Milwaukee

Competition date and time: Wednesday, April 18th, 2018, 9am CDT

Registration is now closed.
