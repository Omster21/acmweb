## Competition Structure:

There are five problems to solve. Scoring details are as follows:

-   Three **Technical Problems** have 5 possible points each to earn,
    totaling 15 points for the technical section.

    -   Points are awarded for how many of the problem requirements were
        fulfilled, and how well they were fulfilled. Partial credit will
        be awarded.

-   Two **Creative Problems** have a possible 15 points each to earn,
    but the creative section is capped at 20 total points.

    -   On one hand, you could balance your effort between the two
        problems to try to earn 10 points on each. Alternatively, you
        could go all-out on one problem to earn 15 points, and only need
        to earn 5 points on the other to get maximum credit.

    -   For this section, in addition to submitting your Scratch project
        file, you will need to submit a short "design document" (.txt
        file from Notepad or Notepad++) listing the features you created
        for your project. Since the creative section is very open-ended,
        this design document lets you "sell" your solution to the
        judges. These problems can take a lot of work, so brag about
        your favorite features of your solution - make sure none of them
        are overlooked!

    -   Points are awarded for how well the solution fits the problem's
        prompt, and the quantity and quality of the features included
        (and listed in the design document).

**Competition Rules:**

-   You will have three hours to work on 5 questions

-   You will receive templates for some of the questions

-   Try to score as many points as possible. You don't have to attempt
    every problem.

-   Submit your solution as soon as it is ready - don't wait to submit
    all your solutions at the end.

-   Judges will give feedback on your solutions throughout the
    competition.

-   There is not a penalty for re-submitting to a problem. You can
    improve your solution according to judge feedback and re-submit to
    earn more points.

-   Do not submit the same solution twice. **Only re-submit to a problem
    if you have changed your solution.**

-   You may use outside sources (your internet, image editing tools,
    etc.) to create sprites, sounds, and other materials for your
    project.

-   You may not take code from public projects on the scratch website,
    or projects you have worked on outside of the competition.

-   You may not collaborate with other teams; sharing materials or
    discussing the problems with other teams is prohibited.

-   You must ask for permission before using electronic storage or
    communication devices (phones, flash drives, etc.), or any
    communication or storage software (email, google drive, etc.).

-   If you are unsure if a specific outside source is permitted, ask a
    room proctor! Room proctors may also request you to stop using a
    specific website or device if they suspect it is being used to break
    the rules of the competition.

Here are a few Scratch tools to be familiar with:

-   Using multiple sprites

-   Motion

-   Looks

-   Sound

-   Events

-   Sensing
