        <p>Welcome to the new Wisconsin-Dairyland Programming Competition preparation area!</p>
        
        <p>Feel free to look around and practice for this years competition using either the Java Preparation questions or questions from previous years. You can do this by clicking the dropdown arrow in the side bar and selecting a previous year.</p>

        <h2>Contest Expectations</h2>
        <p>All contest programs/solutions are expected to read from <code>System.in</code>, write to <code>System.out</code>, and be in the default package. Programs should not prompt for input. All problems are judged based on their output and how it compares to the correct solutions output. <br /></p>

        <p>All problems will come with skeleton code that will handle input and output. All the work done will be inside a provided method where input comes from the parameters and output is returned from the function. <br /> </p>

        <p><b>Use of the skeleton is <em>recommended</em>, but not required.</b><br /></p>

        <p>Many problems will require working with Strings, especially the following methods: <code>length()</code>, <code>charAt()</code>, <code>substring()</code>, <code>equals()</code>, <code>compareTo()</code>, and <code>split()</code>.</p>

        <p>You should know how to convert a String to a corresponding number using methods such as
        <code>Integer.parseInt()</code>, and <code>Double.parseDouble()</code>.</p>

        <p>We assume a basic familiarity with 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional Arrays.</p>

        <p>Contest problems will not involve file I/O other than <code>System.in</code> and <code>System.out</code>. There will be no command line arguments, graphical interface programming, or networking/web programming.</p>

        <p>Many teams find using a development environment such as <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> or <a
            href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> helpful.</p>
