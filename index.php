<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a student group consisting of a variety of people with diverse
    backgrounds who are a common interest in computers.
    We work to promote knowledge and greater interest in the science, design, development, language, management, and
    applications of modern computing.</p>

<h3>What we do?</h3>
<p> Throughout the year we host several events determined by our student body, based on interest, demand, and resources
    we can provide. </p>

        Competition</a>. It is a morning event, 100% student volunteer run, offered to Wisconsin high schools. </p>
